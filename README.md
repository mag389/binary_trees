# Binary Trees
![A basic Binary Tree](./Binary_tree.png)

The use and application of binary tree data structures.
This folder covers several different types of binary trees such as AVL trees 
and binary heaps structures. For each structure there are functions for creation and 
manipulation, as well as some for getting information about the stucture itself 
(is it complete, balanced, etc).

The Files are numbered according to completion and there is a corresponding main file to go with each assigned function file.

to run: compile the main file with dependencies to create a executable file. 
Then run that executable file from a terminal. For example
> gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic binary_tree_print.c 9-binary_tree_height.c 9-main.c 0-binary_tree_node.c 2-binary_tree_insert_right.c -o 9-height

> ./9-height
